# TetrisAI

A very simple, playable implementation of Tetris with an AI that learns to play it.

### The AI
The project includes a deep learning model that uses genetic algorithms to improve.
Since the model converges into a highly optimal playing style so quickly, theres no saving or loading of models.

### How to use
To install the requirements, run the following line while in the root directory of the project:   
 `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the project, run main.py using the interpreter on which you install the requirements, or simply:   
 `python3 main.py`
